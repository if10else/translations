title: Rust Translations
---

This is an **unofficial** document translation project for [Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org).
By aggrigating Rust document translations from the web, the following benefits are achieved.

* As Users
  * can find translations easily from this page
  * can check the original English contents through the language selector in each documents
* As Translators
  * can work for translation with pre-defined workflow

If you are interesting in document translation, please see [the project on GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang-translations/doc).

# Usage

All the documents have a language selector at the top right of the pages.

# Documents

* [The Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang-translations.org/book)
* [The Rust Edition Guide](https://rust-lang-translations.org/edition-guide)
* [The Embedded Rust Book](https://rust-lang-translations.org/embedded-book)
* [The Rustonomicon](https://rust-lang-translations.org/nomicon)
* [The Rust Reference](https://rust-lang-translations.org/reference)
* [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example) : The official site

If you want to add other documents, please open a [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang-translations/doc/issues).

The official [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example) already has some translations, so this project doesn't include it.
